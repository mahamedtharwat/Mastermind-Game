# ðŸ§  Mastermind-Game : 
### The goal of the game is for the codebreaker to guess the secret 4-digit code created by the codemaker. Each digit in the secret code can be one of 6 possible colors (represented by numbers 1 to 6).
## 1. Encapsulation:
   * Consider using private fields for variables like [secretCode], [maxAttempts], and [guess]. This would enforce better encapsulation and restrict direct access from outside the class.
