# ðŸ§  Mastermind-Game : 
### The goal of the game is for the codebreaker to guess the secret 4-digit code created by the codemaker. Each digit in the secret code can be one of 6 possible colors (represented by numbers 1 to 6).
### Your Mastermind game implementation is well-structured and functional. However, here are a few suggestions to enhance the code quality and improve usability:
## 1. Encapsulation:
   * Consider using private fields for variables like [secretCode], [maxAttempts], and [guess]. This would enforce better encapsulation and restrict direct access from outside the class.
   * The secret code generation should be private to avoid modification from other parts of the application.
## 2. Better Error Handling:
   * Improve the error handling in [isValidInput]. For example, instead of just checking the length and range, you can check if the input contains only valid digits.
   * In [parseGuess], you can use [Character.getNumericValue(char)] to convert characters to integers, which is a cleaner and more readable approach.
## 3. Code Readability:
   * Use constants for messages like ["Attempt: "], ["Enter your guess(e.g 1234)"], ["ExactMatches(correct digit and position)"], and ["partialMatches(correct digit, wrong position)"] to make the code more readable 
     and maintainable.
## 4. Testing:
   * Add unit tests for methods like [isValidInput], [parseGuess], [countExactMatches], and [countPartialMatches] to ensure they work as expected.
## 5. Refactoring:
   * Consider creating separate classes for components like game logic, user interface, and validation to adhere to Single Responsibility Principle.
